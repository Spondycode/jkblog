## Blogging with Jekyll is Better than Using Hugo

I don't think I like the way Hugo is organised. Jekyl was a pain to install but doable.
I'll see if I can make the site on Github pages. I wonder if I can use my own domain name on it??

## It was akward with Images in Hugo

Will it be better in Jekyll. Looking forward to finding out.
